	abstract = {A sociological model for the mental health consequences of social organization is distinguished from a sociomedical model for the social etiology of particular disorders. Both models use stress to explain associations between social placement and disorder. These models are not interchangeable, despite apparent similarities, but researchers frequently apply the sociomedical model to sociological questions. Discrepancies between models are illustrated with survey data collected from a community sample of adults. We demonstrate that gender differences in the impact of stress are disorder-specific and do not indicate general differences between women and men in susceptibility to stress.},

	abstract = {The sequencing of the human genome and the advent of low-cost genome-wide assays that generate millions of observations of individual genomes in a matter of hours constitute a disruptive innovation for social science. Many public use social science datasets have or will soon add genome-wide genetic data. With these new data come technical challenges, but also new possibilities. Among these, the lowest-hanging fruit and the most potentially disruptive to existing research programs is the ability to measure previously invisible contours of health and disease risk within populations. In this article, we outline why now is the time for social scientists to bring genetics into their research programs. We discuss how to select genetic variants to study. We explain how the polygenic architecture of complex traits and the low penetrance of individual genetic loci pose challenges to research integrating genetics and social science. We introduce genetic risk scores as a method of addressing these challenges and provide guidance on how genetic risk scores can be constructed. We conclude by outlining research questions that are ripe for social science inquiry.},

However, recent advances in both econometrics and in developmental genomics provide scientists with a novel opportunity to understand how genes and environment interact to produce social outcomes. Key to any causal inference about the interplay between genes and social environment is that either genotype be exogenously manipulated (i.e. through sibling fixed effects) while environmental conditions are held constant, and/or that environmental variation is exogenous in nature, i.e. experimental or arising from a natural experiment of sorts. Further, initial allele selection should be motivated by findings from genetic experiments in model animal studies linked to orthologous human genes. Likewise, genetic associations found in human population studies should then be tested through knock-out and over-expression studies in model organisms.},

	abstract = {Experience of stressful life events is associated with risk of depression. Yet many exposed individuals do not become depressed. A controversial hypothesis is that genetic factors influence vulnerability to depression following stress. This hypothesis is most commonly tested with a "diathesis-stress" model, in which genes confer excess vulnerability. We tested an alternative model, in which genes may buffer against the depressogenic effects of life stress. We measured the hypothesized genetic buffer using a polygenic score derived from a published genome-wide association study ({GWAS}) of subjective wellbeing. We tested if married older adults who had higher polygenic scores were less vulnerable to depressive symptoms following the death of their spouse as compared to age-peers who had also lost their spouse and who had lower polygenic scores. We analyzed data from N=9,453 non-Hispanic white adults in the Health and Retirement Study ({HRS}), a population-representative longitudinal study of older adults in the United States. {HRS} adults with higher wellbeing polygenic scores experienced fewer depressive symptoms during follow-up. Those who survived death of their spouses during follow-up (n=1,829) experienced a sharp increase in depressive symptoms following the death and returned toward baseline over the following two years. Having a higher polygenic score buffered against increased depressive symptoms following a spouse's death. Effects were small and clinical relevance is uncertain, although polygenic score analyses may provide clues to behavioral pathways that can serve as therapeutic targets. Future studies of gene-environment interplay in depression may benefit from focus on genetics discovered for putative protective factors.},

It is unproven that happiness is a direct cause of good health or that negative emotion, worry, and depression are significant direct causes of disease. Instead, depression-related characteristics are likely often reflective of an already-deteriorating trajectory. It is also unproven that challenging work in a demanding environment usually brings long-term health risks; on the contrary, individual strivings for accomplishment and persistent dedication to one's career or community often are associated with sizeable health benefits. Overall, a substantial body of recent research reveals that conscientiousness plays a very significant role in health, with implications across the lifespan. Much more caution is warranted before policy makers offer narrow health recommendations based on short-term or correlational findings. Attention should be shifted to individual trajectories and pathways to health and well-being.},

Little is known about the general population prevalence or severity of {DSM}-{IV} mental disorders.Objective
To estimate 12-month prevalence, severity, and comorbidity of {DSM}-{IV} anxiety, mood, impulse control, and substance disorders in the recently completed {US} National Comorbidity Survey Replication.Design and Setting
Nationally representative face-to-face household survey conducted between February 2001 and April 2003 using a fully structured diagnostic interview, the World Health Organization World Mental Health Survey Initiative version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview.Participants
Nine thousand two hundred eighty-two English-speaking respondents 18 years and older.Main Outcome Measures
Twelve-month {DSM}-{IV} disorders.Results
Twelve-month prevalence estimates were anxiety, 18.1\%; mood, 9.5\%; impulse control, 8.9\%; substance, 3.8\%; and any disorder, 26.2\%. Of 12-month cases, 22.3\% were classified as serious; 37.3\%, moderate; and 40.4\%, mild. Fifty-five percent carried only a single diagnosis; 22\%, 2 diagnoses; and 23\%, 3 or more diagnoses. Latent class analysis detected 7 multivariate disorder classes, including 3 highly comorbid classes representing 7\% of the population.Conclusion
Although mental disorders are widespread, serious cases are concentrated among a relatively small proportion of cases with high comorbidity.},

Third, diffusion arguments suggest that structural change leads to adoption of new ideas and values supportive of gender equality by non-traditional and innovative groups in society, but that the new ideas later diffuse to other groups through cultural processes. Using the General Social Survey from 1977 to 2006 and comparing the determinants of gender egalitarianism across 86 cohorts born from roughly 1900 through 1985, multilevel models support the diffusion arguments.},

Setting We analyzed two waves of longitudinal data on men over 50 who participated in the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative sample of people aged 51–61 and their spouses living in the United States in 1992. Measurements Five types of health outcomes—mortality, general health, functional status, cognitive status, and mental health—were examined. Drinking categories were based on average drinks per day (0, {\textless}1, 1–2, 3–4, 5+), with 5 + defined as ‘very heavy drinking’. Problem drinking history was identified as 2+ affirmative responses to the {CAGE} questionnaire. We controlled for smoking and other factors at baseline. Findings Over the 6-year follow-up period, very heavy drinking at baseline quadrupled the risk of developing functional impairments ({OR}: 4.21 95\% {CI}: 1.67, 10.61). A problem drinking history increased the onset of depression ({OR}: 1.67 95\% {CI}: 1.02, 2.74), psychiatric problems ({OR}: 2.15 95\% {CI}: 1.47, 3.13) and memory problems ({OR}: 1.71 95\% {CI}: 1.14, 2.56). Heavy drinking among mature adults was not associated with increased incidence of other adverse health events (i.e. angina, cancer, congestive heart failure, diabetes, myocardial infraction, lung disease or stroke). Conclusion Very heavy drinking and a problem drinking history greatly increased rates of onset of functional impairments, psychiatric problems and memory loss in late middle age for men who had not experienced these impairments at their initial interview.},

Here, we study genetic contributions to {SWB} in a pooled sample of ≈11,500 unrelated, comprehensively-genotyped Swedish and Dutch individuals. We apply a recently developed method to estimate “common narrow heritability”: the fraction of variance in {SWB} that can be explained by the cumulative additive effects of genetic polymorphisms that are common in the population. Our estimates are 5–10\% for single-question survey measures of {SWB}, and 12–18\% after correction for measurement error in the {SWB} measures. Our results suggest guarded optimism about the prospects of using genetic data in {SWB} research because, although the common narrow heritability is not large, the polymorphisms that contribute to it could feasibly be discovered with a sufficiently large sample of individuals.},

	abstract = {Context 
Gender differences in mental disorders, including more anxiety and mood disorders among women and more externalizing disorders among men, are found consistently in epidemiological surveys. The gender roles hypothesis suggests that these differences narrow as the roles of women and men become more equal.Objectives
To study time-space (cohort-country) variation in gender differences in lifetime {DSM}-{IV} mental disorders across cohorts in 15 countries in the World Health Organization World Mental Health Survey Initiative and to determine if this variation is significantly related to time-space variation in female gender role traditionality as measured by aggregate patterns of female education, employment, marital timing, and use of birth control.Design
Face-to-face household surveys.Setting
Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and the Pacific.Participants
Community-dwelling adults (N = 72 933).Main Outcome Measures
The World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview assessed lifetime prevalence and age at onset of 18 {DSM}-{IV} anxiety, mood, externalizing, and substance disorders. Survival analyses estimated time-space variation in female to male odds ratios of these disorders across cohorts defined by the following age ranges: 18 to 34, 35 to 49, 50 to 64, and 65 years and older. Structural equation analysis examined predictive effects of variation in gender role traditionality on these odds ratios.Results
In all cohorts and countries, women had more anxiety and mood disorders than men, and men had more externalizing and substance disorders than women. Although gender differences were generally consistent across cohorts, significant narrowing was found in recent cohorts for major depressive disorder and substance disorders. This narrowing was significantly related to temporal (major depressive disorder) and spatial (substance disorders) variation in gender role traditionality.Conclusions
While gender differences in most lifetime mental disorders were fairly stable over the time-space units studied, substantial intercohort narrowing of differences in major depression was found to be related to changes in the traditionality of female gender roles. Additional research is needed to understand why this temporal narrowing was confined to major depression.},

Central to his hypothesis is that marriage is emotionally advantageous for men and disadvantageous for women. This article revisits this topic with data from the National Survey of Families and Households. The analyses indicate that the emotional benefits of marriage apply equally to men and women, but that men and women respond to marital transitions with different types of emotional problems. The implications of these findings for future research on gender and mental health are discussed.},

This article is concerned with how these patterns impact the health of U.S. workers. Drawing on recent data from the U.S. Panel Study of Income Dynamics, I find that job loss harms health, beyond sicker people being more likely to lose their jobs. Respondents who lost jobs but were reemployed at the survey faced an increased risk of developing new health conditions; they were not, however, more likely to describe their health in negative terms. This suggests that recent job “churning” within the United States (i.e., high rates of job loss but low unemployment) may impact certain health outcomes but not others. I find no evidence that the health consequences of job loss differ across white- and blue-collar occupations, although health-related selection out of jobs appears stronger within the blue-collar category.},

	  Drawing on the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, I track the subjective well-being of individuals as they enter and exit unemployment. Job loss is a salient trigger event that sets off large changes in well-being. The factors expected to improve the lot of the unemployed have limited efficacy: (1) changes in family income are not significantly correlated with well-being; (2) unemployment insurance eligibility seems to partly mitigate the effect of job loss, but is a poor substitute for work; and (3) even reemployment recovers only about two thirds of the initial harm of job loss, indicating a potential long-term scar effect of unemployment. This highlights the deep and intractable hardship caused by unemployment in America.},
