	abstract = {This paper focuses on financial strain across the life course as a condition underlying health inequalities observed in later life. The analysis is based on data from 1,167 adults 65 years and older collected as part of the "Aging, Stress and Health Study." Relying on retrospective data about hardship experienced over the life course, we find that long-term financial hardship is reflected in a range of health outcomes at late life, even after controlling for the effects of current financial circumstances. Moreover, the sheer persistence of hardship matters more than its episodic occurrence or timing, so that the health effects of early hardship may be obviated if followed by no further hardship. This pattern of findings is consistent with the notion of allostatic load, the cumulative damage done to health and well-being under the burden of an unrelenting stressor in a critically important life domain.},

Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses reveal those reporting multiple reasons for major discrimination are at increased risk for lifetime major depression and subsequent depressive symptoms. While social support and mastery partially mediated the link between multiple perceived reasons for discrimination and subsequent depressive symptoms, this psychological risk was not fully explained by these coping resources. Together the findings underscore the psychological toxicity of perceived discrimination and the importance of considering multiple perceived reasons for discrimination as a risk factor for poor mental health.},

It takes involuntary job disruptions as illustrating life events and shows how they adversely affect enduring role strains, economic strains in particular. These exacerbated strains, in turn, erode positive concepts of self, such as self-esteem and mastery. The diminished self-concepts then leave one especially vulnerable to experiencing symptoms of stress, of which depression is of special interest to this analysis. The interventions of coping and social supports are mainly indirect; that is, they do not act directly to buffer depression.

	isbn = {978-1-61044-747-8},
	shorttitle = {Good Jobs, Bad Jobs},
	abstract = {The economic boom of the 1990s veiled a grim reality: in addition to the growing gap between rich and poor, the gap between good and bad quality jobs was also expanding. The postwar prosperity of the mid-twentieth century had enabled millions of American workers to join the middle class, but as author Arne L. Kalleberg shows, by the 1970s this upward movement had slowed, in part due to the steady disappearance of secure, well-paying industrial jobs. Ever since, precarious employment has been on the rise—paying low wages, offering few benefits, and with virtually no long-term security. Today, the polarization between workers with higher skill levels and those with low skills and low wages is more entrenched than ever. Good Jobs, Bad Jobs traces this trend to large-scale transformations in the American labor market and the changing demographics of low-wage workers. Kalleberg draws on nearly four decades of survey data, as well as his own research, to evaluate trends in U.S. job quality and suggest ways to improve American labor market practices and social policies. Good Jobs, Bad Jobs provides an insightful analysis of how and why precarious employment is gaining ground in the labor market and the role these developments have played in the decline of the middle class. Kalleberg shows that by the 1970s, government deregulation, global competition, and the rise of the service sector gained traction, while institutional protections for workers—such as unions and minimum-wage legislation—weakened. Together, these forces marked the end of postwar security for American workers. The composition of the labor force also changed significantly; the number of dual-earner families increased, as did the share of the workforce comprised of women, non-white, and immigrant workers. Of these groups, blacks, Latinos, and immigrants remain concentrated in the most precarious and low-quality jobs, with educational attainment being the leading indicator of who will earn the highest wages and experience the most job security and highest levels of autonomy and control over their jobs and schedules. Kalleberg demonstrates, however, that building a better safety net—increasing government responsibility for worker health care and retirement, as well as strengthening unions—can go a long way toward redressing the effects of today’s volatile labor market.There is every reason to expect that the growth of precarious jobs—which already make up a significant share of the American job market—will continue. Good Jobs, Bad Jobs deftly shows that the decline in U.S. job quality is not the result of fluctuations in the business cycle, but rather the result of economic restructuring and the disappearance of institutional protections for workers. Only government, employers and labor working together on long-term strategies—including an expanded safety net, strengthened legal protections, and better training opportunities—can help reverse this trend.

We find respondents with higher levels of job insecurity in 2010 reported lower levels of happiness compared to those similarly insecure in 2006. The positive relationship between job insecurity and days of poor mental health becomes more pronounced for those in the third quartile of personal income in 2010, suggesting middle-class vulnerability during the economic downturn. Men (but not women) with higher insecurity report more days of poor mental health in both 2006 and 2010. These findings reinforce a “cycles of control” theoretical approach, given the mental health–job insecurity relationship is heightened for workers in turbulent times.},

These approaches use meaning to improve the prediction of stress outcomes but neglect their social origins. Two new lines of research on meaning are proposed to address this limitation: the structural and cultural origins of meaning and the process of meaning negotiation. These lines of research broaden the view of the “social” in social stress research and allow a more comprehensive understanding of the processes through which social arrangements affect personal distress.},

Gender differences in mental disorders, including more anxiety and mood disorders among women and more externalizing disorders among men, are found consistently in epidemiological surveys. The gender roles hypothesis suggests that these differences narrow as the roles of women and men become more equal.Objectives
To study time-space (cohort-country) variation in gender differences in lifetime {DSM}-{IV} mental disorders across cohorts in 15 countries in the World Health Organization World Mental Health Survey Initiative and to determine if this variation is significantly related to time-space variation in female gender role traditionality as measured by aggregate patterns of female education, employment, marital timing, and use of birth control.Design
Face-to-face household surveys.Setting
Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and the Pacific.Participants
Community-dwelling adults (N = 72 933).Main Outcome Measures
The World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview assessed lifetime prevalence and age at onset of 18 {DSM}-{IV} anxiety, mood, externalizing, and substance disorders. Survival analyses estimated time-space variation in female to male odds ratios of these disorders across cohorts defined by the following age ranges: 18 to 34, 35 to 49, 50 to 64, and 65 years and older. Structural equation analysis examined predictive effects of variation in gender role traditionality on these odds ratios.Results
In all cohorts and countries, women had more anxiety and mood disorders than men, and men had more externalizing and substance disorders than women. Although gender differences were generally consistent across cohorts, significant narrowing was found in recent cohorts for major depressive disorder and substance disorders. This narrowing was significantly related to temporal (major depressive disorder) and spatial (substance disorders) variation in gender role traditionality.Conclusions
While gender differences in most lifetime mental disorders were fairly stable over the time-space units studied, substantial intercohort narrowing of differences in major depression was found to be related to changes in the traditionality of female gender roles. Additional research is needed to understand why this temporal narrowing was confined to major depression.},

The analysis combines age-specific prevalence rates of subjective well-being from a large nationally representative survey and life table estimates of mortality in decennial Census years. Employing the period prevalence-rate life table method—Sullivan method, the analysis finds evidence for improvement in quality of life in the U.S. Happy life expectancy largely increased in both absolute terms (number of years) and relative terms (proportion of life) over time at all adult ages examined. And increases in total life expectancy were mainly contributed by increases in expectancy in happy years rather than unhappy years. Happy life expectancy is longer than active life expectancy. And there has been greater compression of unhappiness than compression of morbidity. There are substantial differentials in happy life expectancy by sex and race because of differential prevalence rates of happiness. Women and whites had longer years of total and happy life expectancies at most ages and dates, while men and blacks had greater proportions of happy life expectancies across the three decades. Although race differentials generally decreased at older ages and with time, relative disadvantages of blacks persisted.},

Nationally representative face-to-face household survey conducted between February 2001 and April 2003 using a fully structured diagnostic interview, the World Health Organization World Mental Health Survey Initiative version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview.Participants
Nine thousand two hundred eighty-two English-speaking respondents 18 years and older.Main Outcome Measures

Twelve-month prevalence estimates were anxiety, 18.1\%; mood, 9.5\%; impulse control, 8.9\%; substance, 3.8\%; and any disorder, 26.2\%. Of 12-month cases, 22.3\% were classified as serious; 37.3\%, moderate; and 40.4\%, mild. Fifty-five percent carried only a single diagnosis; 22\%, 2 diagnoses; and 23\%, 3 or more diagnoses. Latent class analysis detected 7 multivariate disorder classes, including 3 highly comorbid classes representing 7\% of the population.Conclusion

Key to any causal inference about the interplay between genes and social environment is that either genotype be exogenously manipulated (i.e. through sibling fixed effects) while environmental conditions are held constant, and/or that environmental variation is exogenous in nature, i.e. experimental or arising from a natural experiment of sorts. Further, initial allele selection should be motivated by findings from genetic experiments in model animal studies linked to orthologous human genes. Likewise, genetic associations found in human population studies should then be tested through knock-out and over-expression studies in model organisms.},

	abstract = {Experience of stressful life events is associated with risk of depression. Yet many exposed individuals do not become depressed. A controversial hypothesis is that genetic factors influence vulnerability to depression following stress. This hypothesis is most commonly tested with a "diathesis-stress" model, in which genes confer excess vulnerability. We tested an alternative model, in which genes may buffer against the depressogenic effects of life stress. We measured the hypothesized genetic buffer using a polygenic score derived from a published genome-wide association study ({GWAS}) of subjective wellbeing. We tested if married older adults who had higher polygenic scores were less vulnerable to depressive symptoms following the death of their spouse as compared to age-peers who had also lost their spouse and who had lower polygenic scores. We analyzed data from N=9,453 non-Hispanic white adults in the Health and Retirement Study ({HRS}), a population-representative longitudinal study of older adults in the United States. {HRS} adults with higher wellbeing polygenic scores experienced fewer depressive symptoms during follow-up. Those who survived death of their spouses during follow-up (n=1,829) experienced a sharp increase in depressive symptoms following the death and returned toward baseline over the following two years. Having a higher polygenic score buffered against increased depressive symptoms following a spouse's death. Effects were small and clinical relevance is uncertain, although polygenic score analyses may provide clues to behavioral pathways that can serve as therapeutic targets. Future studies of gene-environment interplay in depression may benefit from focus on genetics discovered for putative protective factors.},

Many public use social science datasets have or will soon add genome-wide genetic data. With these new data come technical challenges, but also new possibilities. Among these, the lowest-hanging fruit and the most potentially disruptive to existing research programs is the ability to measure previously invisible contours of health and disease risk within populations. In this article, we outline why now is the time for social scientists to bring genetics into their research programs. We discuss how to select genetic variants to study. We explain how the polygenic architecture of complex traits and the low penetrance of individual genetic loci pose challenges to research integrating genetics and social science. We introduce genetic risk scores as a method of addressing these challenges and provide guidance on how genetic risk scores can be constructed. We conclude by outlining research questions that are ripe for social science inquiry.},

This article is concerned with how these patterns impact the health of U.S. workers. Drawing on recent data from the U.S. Panel Study of Income Dynamics, I find that job loss harms health, beyond sicker people being more likely to lose their jobs. Respondents who lost jobs but were reemployed at the survey faced an increased risk of developing new health conditions; they were not, however, more likely to describe their health in negative terms. This suggests that recent job “churning” within the United States (i.e., high rates of job loss but low unemployment) may impact certain health outcomes but not others. I find no evidence that the health consequences of job loss differ across white- and blue-collar occupations, although health-related selection out of jobs appears stronger within the blue-collar category.},

It is unproven that happiness is a direct cause of good health or that negative emotion, worry, and depression are significant direct causes of disease. Instead, depression-related characteristics are likely often reflective of an already-deteriorating trajectory. It is also unproven that challenging work in a demanding environment usually brings long-term health risks; on the contrary, individual strivings for accomplishment and persistent dedication to one's career or community often are associated with sizeable health benefits. Overall, a substantial body of recent research reveals that conscientiousness plays a very significant role in health, with implications across the lifespan. Much more caution is warranted before policy makers offer narrow health recommendations based on short-term or correlational findings. Attention should be shifted to individual trajectories and pathways to health and well-being.},

	  Drawing on the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, I track the subjective well-being of individuals as they enter and exit unemployment. Job loss is a salient trigger event that sets off large changes in well-being. The factors expected to improve the lot of the unemployed have limited efficacy: (1) changes in family income are not significantly correlated with well-being; (2) unemployment insurance eligibility seems to partly mitigate the effect of job loss, but is a poor substitute for work; and (3) even reemployment recovers only about two thirds of the initial harm of job loss, indicating a potential long-term scar effect of unemployment. This highlights the deep and intractable hardship caused by unemployment in America.},

We apply a recently developed method to estimate “common narrow heritability”: the fraction of variance in {SWB} that can be explained by the cumulative additive effects of genetic polymorphisms that are common in the population. Our estimates are 5–10\% for single-question survey measures of {SWB}, and 12–18\% after correction for measurement error in the {SWB} measures. Our results suggest guarded optimism about the prospects of using genetic data in {SWB} research because, although the common narrow heritability is not large, the polymorphisms that contribute to it could feasibly be discovered with a sufficiently large sample of individuals.},

Setting We analyzed two waves of longitudinal data on men over 50 who participated in the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative sample of people aged 51–61 and their spouses living in the United States in 1992. Measurements Five types of health outcomes—mortality, general health, functional status, cognitive status, and mental health—were examined. Drinking categories were based on average drinks per day (0, {\textless}1, 1–2, 3–4, 5+), with 5 + defined as ‘very heavy drinking’. Problem drinking history was identified as 2+ affirmative responses to the {CAGE} questionnaire. We controlled for smoking and other factors at baseline. Findings Over the 6-year follow-up period, very heavy drinking at baseline quadrupled the risk of developing functional impairments ({OR}: 4.21 95\% {CI}: 1.67, 10.61). A problem drinking history increased the onset of depression ({OR}: 1.67 95\% {CI}: 1.02, 2.74), psychiatric problems ({OR}: 2.15 95\% {CI}: 1.47, 3.13) and memory problems ({OR}: 1.71 95\% {CI}: 1.14, 2.56). Heavy drinking among mature adults was not associated with increased incidence of other adverse health events (i.e. angina, cancer, congestive heart failure, diabetes, myocardial infraction, lung disease or stroke). Conclusion Very heavy drinking and a problem drinking history greatly increased rates of onset of functional impairments, psychiatric problems and memory loss in late middle age for men who had not experienced these impairments at their initial interview.},

However, the impact of burns on individuals with different personality traits can be different. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of dispositional optimism on the subjective well-being of burn patients, and mainly focused on the confirmation of the mediator role of psychological resilience. 410 burn patients from five general hospitals in Xi'an accomplished the revised Life Orientation Test, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and Subjective Well-Being ({SWB}) scale. The results revealed that both dispositional optimism and psychological resilience were significantly correlated with {SWB}. Structural equation modelling indicated that psychological resilience partially mediated the relationship between dispositional optimism and {SWB}. The current findings extended prior reports and shed some light on how dispositional optimism influenced {SWB}. Limitations of the study were considered and suggestions for future studies were also discussed.},

For example, prospective longitudinal studies of normal populations provide evidence that various types of subjective well-being such as positive affect predict health and longevity, controlling for health and socioeconomic status at baseline. Combined with experimental human and animal research, as well as naturalistic studies of changes of subjective well-being and physiological processes over time, the case that subjective well-being influences health and longevity in healthy populations is compelling. However, the claim that subjective well-being lengthens the lives of those with certain diseases such as cancer remains controversial. Positive feelings predict longevity and health beyond negative feelings. However, intensely aroused or manic positive affect may be detrimental to health. Issues such as causality, effect size, types of subjective well-being, and statistical controls are discussed.},

	abstract = {Background
Genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}) have been unable to identify variants linked to depression. We hypothesized that examining depressive symptoms and considering gene-environment interaction (G×E) might improve efficiency for gene discovery. We therefore conducted a {GWAS} and genome-wide environment interaction study ({GWEIS}) of depressive symptoms.

Methods
Using data from the {SHARe} cohort of the Women’s Health Initiative, comprising African Americans (n=7179) and Hispanics/Latinas (n=3138), we examined genetic main effects and G×E with stressful life events and social support. We also conducted a heritability analysis using genome-wide complex trait analysis ({GCTA}). Replication was attempted in four independent cohorts.

Results
No {SNPs} achieved genome-wide significance for main effects in either discovery sample. The top signals in African Americans were rs73531535 (located 20kb from {GPR}139, p=5.75×10−8) and rs75407252 (intronic to {CACNA}2D3, p=6.99×10−7). In Hispanics/Latinas, the top signals were rs2532087 (located 27kb from {CD}38, p=2.44×10−7) and rs4542757 (intronic to {DCC}, p=7.31×10−7). In the {GWEIS} with stressful life events, one interaction signal was genome-wide significant in African Americans (rs4652467; p=4.10×10−10; located 14kb from {CEP}350). This interaction was not observed in a smaller replication cohort. Although heritability estimates for depressive symptoms and stressful life events were each less than 10\%, they were strongly genetically correlated ({rG}=0.95), suggesting that common variation underlying depressive symptoms and stressful life event exposure, though modest on their own, were highly overlapping in this sample.

Conclusions
Our results underscore the need for larger samples, more {GWEIS}, and greater investigation into genetic and environmental determinants of depressive symptoms in minorities.},

	abstract = {Background
Previous studies suggest that the relationship between genetic risk and depression may be moderated by stressful life events ({SLEs}). The goal of this study was to assess whether {SLEs} moderate the association between polygenic risk of Major Depressive Disorder ({MDD}) and depressive symptoms in older adults.

Methods
We used logistic and negative binomial regressions to assess the associations between polygenic risk, {SLEs} and depressive symptoms in a sample of 8,761 participants from the Health and Retirement Study ({HRS}). Polygenic scores were derived from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium ({PGC}) genome-wide association study ({GWAS}) of {MDD}. {SLEs} were operationalized as a dichotomous variable indicating whether participants had experienced at least 1 stressful event during the previous two years. Depressive symptoms were measured using an 8-item {CES}-D subscale and operationalized as both a dichotomous and a count variable.

Results
The odds of reporting ≥ 4 depressive symptoms were over twice as high among individuals who experienced at least one {SLE} ({OR} = 2.19, 95\% {CI} = [1.86, 2.58]). Polygenic scores were significantly associated with depressive symptoms (β = .21, p = {\textless}.0001), although the variance explained was modest (Pseudo r2 = .0095). None of the interaction terms for polygenic scores and {SLEs} were statistically significant.

Conclusions
Polygenic risk and {SLEs} are robust, independent predictors of depressive symptoms in older adults. Consistent with an additive model, we found no evidence that {SLEs} moderated the association between common variant polygenic risk and depressive symptoms.},
