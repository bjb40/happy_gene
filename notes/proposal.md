#Introduction

This document outlines a propsal for three separate gene/environment studies using the HRS on subjective well-being/Depression. Broadly, this study can include measures of life satisfaction, happiness, cognition, depression, substance abuse, and other psychological or internalized processes. Many of these were recently used in a large GWAS [@okbay_genetic_2016], which has been cross-applied to the HRS [@domingue_genetic_2016]. This proposal (1) outlines basic social science literature on psychological disorders and subjective well-being, (2) examines the implicaiton of incorporating genetic informaiton to these theoretical models, and (3) propose three different studies.

Study 1 is a fairly direct extension of the work by Domingue, et al. [-@domingue_genetic_2016]. This paper finds that different rates of decay in elevated depressive symptoms after a spouse dies are correlated with polygenic scores (PGS) calculated from the GWAS mentioned above. The proposed study proposes an identical design, but instead of using spousal death as the exogonous environmental treatment, it will use variability in economic conditions (unemployment rate, the great recession, and perhaps exposure to recessive periods in the past). Apart from extending the study above, this is also a fairly direct extension of dissertation work comprising the first chapter of my disseratation (although it uses the GSS).

Study 2 addresses the long-term problem of understanding why there is a gendered difference in depression between men and women. Explanations include biological differences between men and women, differences in the level of exposure to stressful events leading to depression, and gendered responses to stress, which postulates that women are prone to internalizing disorders (like depression) while men are prone to externalizing disorders (like substance abouse). Utilizing data on genetic predispositons to depressive symptoms, ... ```better explanadtion``` . Apart from PGS, there are also a number of specific genetic pathways that have been discovered and/or proposed to contribute to this difference. 

Study 3 addresses polygenicity of depression and subjective well-being with cognition. For may years, studies have linked depression and cognitive processes with depression and well-being. Underlying differences in well-being is *comparative* and *counterfactual* thinking. For depression it is the *perception* of support and disadvantage, and not the objective measure of support and disadvantage that is most important. Moreover, there are regularized life-course shapes to subjective well-being and age. These regularized patterns are often explained by regularized changes in cognitive assessments of life, *i.e.* people become happier and less depressed with age, because they engage in more downward counterfactuals ... ```fill in ```. While large studies of intergenetic correlation show only a weak (and not statistically significant) correlation between major depression and Alzheimer's disease, it is possible (and perhaps likely) that subclinical manifestations of the diseases will be more strongly correlated.

#Proposed Studies

The first study is a simple test of genetic vulnerability or resistance to depressive events. This has been characterized in some corners as the "diathesis-stress" model, but crosses disciplinary boundaries and is a vulnerability and resilience model. Studies have found inconsistent results using both candidate gene models and polygenic score models ```need citations here```

A great example of a simple and straightforward study along these lines is Dominigue, et al. [-@domingue_genetic_2016], which finds genetic robustness to the death of a spouse. They use a very straightforward approach. (1) They match SNPs in the HRS to SNPS in the GWAS conducted by Okbay et al. [-@okbay_genetics_2016] available through the Social Science Genetic Association Consortium. (2) They sum the weighted estimates of well-being associated alleles from the GWAS to calculate a polygenic score. (3) They adjusted the residulized PGS using 10 principal components and PLINK (command: pca), and normalized the PGS residual distribution, which they used as the measure of genetic predisposition to well-being. They then used a disconitnuity regression design centered on the loss of a spouse, and find faster decay in depressive symptoms for those with higher PGS for well-being, concluding that the PGS represents a genetic robustness to negative stressors.

In this case, I would propose constructing the polygenic score in an identical manner (this may likely require Okbay as a coauthor--Dan Belsky tells me that this can occur given a simple request; and it is a request that he is willing to make for us). Alternatives also include testing of candidate genes (table and citaitons above in Table 1), or building our own polygenic score out of the HRS. Instead of the exteme distress of spousal death, I propose modelling the association with (1) short-term fluctuations in the unemployment rate, and/or (2) the experience of a recession in young adulthood. This builds on previous work of mine that does not include biomarkers, which is currently drafted and under review.

From that work, short-term fluctuations in well-being (measured by both satisfaction and depression) follow short-term differneces in economic circumstances (as measured by the unemployment rate). The question is whether these short-term effects are distributed across genetic endowments. Moreover, do these effects indicate a buffer or a sensitivity? Do they vary accross positive and negative stimuli? Are there thresholds?

2. Heterogeneity in Genetic Correlates of Gendered differences in Depressive Symptoms by Cohort.

``` need to include citaitons from this below ```

A number of consistent patterns in psychological well-being are related to gender. First and foremost, women report higher prevalence of affective disorders like Major Depressive Disorder, whether measured continuously or dichotomously (Aneshensel et al. 1991; Kessler et al. 2005; Seedat S et al. 2009). In contrast, men report higher prevalence of substance abuse disorders such as alcoholism and drug addiction (Simon 2002). Explanations for these differences include (1) fundamental biological differences; (2) differential exposure to stress across genders; (3) differential errors in diagnosis across genders; and (4) differentials in gendered responses to stress across gender, *i.e.* women use internalizing strategies, while men use externalizing strategies.

A recent review in psychology provides a very good overview of this literature, including a summary (and links) to genomic studies in this area ```citation```. The following is a list of candidate genes which have been investigated for gendered differences (original studies referenced in the review). 

**Candidate Genes**

|Gene|Summary|
|:---|:------|
| 5-HTTLPR | Most-studied, including meta-analysis of 78 studies. Shows differences in externalizing & internalizing propensities, and their are different distributions of a "short" allele frequency in a promoter gene across gender|
| FKBP5 | including SNP rs1360780 --- involved in the stress system|
| CRHR1 | including SNP rs110402 --- protective effect related to childhood trauma |

The review notes that the studies are still sparse and inconsistent, particularly because genetic factors appear to be pleiotropic. The review does not note any studies regarding polygenic risk scores (although there must be some somewhere), despite the fact that the pleiotropy and the complexity of the trait suggests that this is perhaps a more reasonable approach as explained by Belsky ```citation```. In addition to the failure to use a broader strategy, prior research has also ignored possible heterogeneity in gendered social structures across various cohorts.

An instructive illustration of the potential importance of heterogeneity in social structures is covered by Boardman ```cite```. That study presents evidence of differences in gene-environment interactions across cohorts related to the Surgeon General's warning about smoking in 1964. Before and after this period, there was a great deal of movement around smoking. Similary (though perhaps not as dramatic), there were also significant changes in gendered institutions, including a civil rights act outlawing gender discrimination in 1963, and an important law on gender equality in higher education (Title IX) in 1972. These co-occur with large changes in gender egalitarianism around the same time ```pampel 2011```, although structural changes have still lagged behind to some degree. 

Using Boardman, et al. ```cite``` to frame the question, the study is easily crossapplicable using both candidate gene and PGS score approaches. They lay out three potential effects of these sorts of social environments on the ability to identify genetic corrleates of complex behavior.

First, is the idea of a *Social Trigger.* In this case, genetic differneces occur only in the presence of norms. This effect is predicted by "Sex Role Theory". More than forty years ago Gove and Tudor (1973) proposed sex role thoey as an explanation for th e gender discrepancy in mental health. Gove and Tudor hypothesized that gendered differences in psychological well-being arose out of women's restriction to a very narrow set roles: primarily wife and mother. This was more true for the oldest cohorts, and less true for younger cohorts. To the extent the theory is correct, we should find evidence of social trigger (*i.e.* gendered effects) for older cohorts, but not for younger cohorts. This seems to be the strongest theoretical hook.

Second, is the phenomenon of *Social Control.* In this case, norms eliminate genetic differences by requiring homogeneity or heterogeneity in individuals regardless of personal (or biological) preference. This theory is implied by gendered response theory. In other words, ...

Finally is the conept of *Social Push.* This theory is non-causal, and suggests that social norms either minimize or generate noise fo the presence of genetic effects. For example, if there is a genetic cause of smoking, but everyone smokes, then there is no statistical leverage to find the genetic effect (because there is no variance in the behavior). This difference between this and social control is the concept of cause. Accordingly, similar evidence and analysis are potentially applicable.

3. Cross association with cognition (some GWAS for cognition at SSGA). GxG interaction and/or Something demographic, like "happy" LE. Associations between happiness and ADL/IADL. Effect of PGS on buffering this sort of stuff. Multistate LE: happiness, cognition (low SWB is a cognitive process...).

SWB is bound up with cognition.
