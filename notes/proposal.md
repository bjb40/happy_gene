#Introduction

This document outlines a propsal for three separate gene/environment studies using the HRS on subjective well-being/Depression. Broadly, this study can include measures of life satisfaction, happiness, cognition, depression, substance abuse, and other psychological or internalized processes. Many of these were recently used in a large GWAS [@okaby_genetic_2016], which has been cross-applied to the HRS [@dominique_genetic_2016]. This proposal (1) outlines basic social science literature on psychological disorders and subjective well-being, (2) examines the implicaiton of incorporating genetic informaiton to these theoretical models, and (3) propose three different studies.

Study 1 is a fairly direct extension of the work by Dominique, et al. [-@dominique_genetic_2016]. This paper finds that different rates of decay in elevated depressive symptoms after a spouse dies are correlated with polygenic scores (PGS) calculated from the GWAS mentioned above. The proposed study proposes an identical design, but instead of using spousal death as the exogonous environmental treatment, it will use variability in economic conditions (unemployment rate, the great recession, and perhaps exposure to recessive periods in the past). Apart from extending the study above, this is also a fairly direct extension of dissertation work comprising the first chapter of my disseratation (although it uses the GSS).

Study 2 addresses the long-term problem of understanding why there is a gendered difference in depression between men and women. Explanations include biological differences between men and women, differences in the level of exposure to stressful events leading to depression, and gendered responses to stress, which postulates that women are prone to internalizing disorders (like depression) while men are prone to externalizing disorders (like substance abouse). Utilizing data on genetic predispositons to depressive symptoms, ... ```better explanadtion``` . Apart from PGS, there are also a number of specific genetic pathways that have been discovered and/or proposed to contribute to this difference. 

Study 3 addresses polygenicity of depression and subjective well-being with cognition. For may years, studies have linked depression and cognitive processes with depression and well-being. Underlying differences in well-being is *comparative* and *counterfactual* thinking. For depression it is the *perception* of support and disadvantage, and not the objective measure of support and disadvantage that is most important. Moreover, there are regularized life-course shapes to subjective well-being and age. These regularized patterns are often explained by regularized changes in cognitive assessments of life, *i.e.* people become happier and less depressed with age, because they engage in more downward counterfactuals ... ```fill in ```. While large studies of intergenetic correlation show only a weak (and not statistically significant) correlation between major depression and Alzheimer's disease, it is possible (and perhaps likely) that subclinical manifestations of the diseases will be more strongly correlated.

#Approaches

1. Something simple like Dominique, et al. --- using sensitivity to great recession, or short-term fluctuations in , or sensitivity to depression in YA time period.
   a. Diathesis stress
   b. Stress buffering

2. Something demographic, like "happy" LE. Associations between happiness and ADL/IADL. Effect of PGS on buffering this sort of stuff. Multistate LE: happiness, cognition (low SWB is a cognitive process...).

3. Cross association with cognition (some GWAS for cognition at SSGA).

4. Population capacity for well-being conditioned on genes?

5. Curve of happiness across life.... (growth-cruve like analysis)

6. Graft on genes with what's his name...
